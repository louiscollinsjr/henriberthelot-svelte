The sun rose over the city, painting the Elisabetin rooftops in gold. Henri Bertholot adjusted his hat, scanning the quiet street for anything out of place. Today, he felt, would not be ordinary.

<br/>

*Timișoara is a city of layers.* History here doesn’t rest quietly—it leans out of balconies, echoes down tram lines, and stains the edges of building facades. But of all the city’s quarters, it’s Elisabetin that hums with a quieter kind of mystery. Once a neighborhood of Hungarian aristocrats and dusty ecclesiastical records, it’s now a mix of students, retirees, and residents who’ve seen too much and say too little.

<br/>

On Strada Henri Berthelot, the cobblestones remember things. The courtyard gates creak a little louder when they open, and even the graffiti seems half-erased, as though second thoughts follow first intentions.

Louis had lived here for nearly four years. An American by birth, married now into the rhythms of Romania. He knew the baker who sold yesterday’s bread with a wink. He knew when the embassy guards switched shifts. He knew which parking spots were tolerated—and which were not.

<br/>

So when he and Ana walked to their truck that gray April morning, umbrella in hand and late for the mechanic, they didn’t expect a message waiting for them. But there it was: the rear windshield wiper, snapped in two, like a dry twig. And when the first drops of rain began to fall, they discovered the second: the front wiper, ripped clean off.

<br/>

Accidents don’t look like that. This was deliberate.

<br/>

In a city like Timișoara, a broken wiper can be a threat. A reminder. A warning meant not just for you, but for anyone who dares to forget who owns the curb.
